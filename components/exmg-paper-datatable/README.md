exmg-paper-datatable [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ExmgElements/exmg-paper-datatable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ExmgElements/exmg-paper-datatable)
================

Polymer 2.0 Material design datatable. Please visit the [API Documentation and demo](http://ExmgElements.github.io/exmg-paper-datatable/) page for more information.

Please note due to the removal of support for extending native elements in Polymer 2.0 it was not possible to create a hybrid approach for the data table. Old version is available here [EXM-DATATABLE Polymer 1.0](https://github.com/exmg/exm-datatable).

Supports:
 - Paper(Material design) style data table
 - Toolbar
 - Paging/Sorting
 - Sorting/filtering helper elements for working with local data sets
 - Easily customizable like expandable rows

## Install

Install the component using bower

```
$ bower install --save exmg-paper-datatable
```

## Development

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed. Then run polymer server to launch the demo page.

```
$ polymer serve
```
